Unit testing in this mod is implemented using a custom JUnit runner
provided by [MinecraftJUnit](https://github.com/BuiltBrokenModding/MinecraftJUnit).

Running the tests should work out of the box.

Previous renditions of testing in this mod worked by compiling the test cases with a custom written test harness,
then running it in the actual game by using a unit test item.
